## Downloadables

https://www.blender.org/ - Blender for 3D sculpting... Technically has its own game engine built in and is also used to make movies!

https://www.gimp.org/ - The most unfortunately named bit of software, great for textures and some image manipulation. Can be used for sprite sheets too if you don't want more things to download!

https://www.aseprite.org/ - For all your 2D game dev spriting needs, this is the go-to

## Game Engines

https://unity.com/ - The Unity game engine. Lots of documentation and resources available here. Huge community, check out Discord servers for even more community support. Uses C# primarily

https://godotengine.org/ - Godot is an open source engine for 2D and 3D games. If you value open source primarily, this is picking up traction fast! Uses gdscript or C#

https://www.unrealengine.com/ - Mostly for 3D games, Unreal is super powerful and is one of the industry standards. Uses C++.
